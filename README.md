# TL;DR
You don't need this dokuwiki plugin.

# Long description
This dokuwiki plugin is developed to do Chinese character replacement to its "canonical" form, to meet specific requirement of a linguist. The exact replacement is defined in the dictionary table. I recap, you don't need this dokuwiki plugin. As such I will not publish this plugin to dokuwiki plugin repository.
